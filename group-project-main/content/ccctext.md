Administrative Director: Marley Levy
The administrative director handles day to day housekeeping tasks for the organization by reserving rooms, managing the listserv, and planning social events for members. On day of show she heads the hospitality crew, which provides food and assembles the dressing rooms for the artist.
Finance Director: Vincent Eynon
The finance director oversees the organization’s budget, ensures that ticketing policies are in order, and works with other organizations for the co-sponsorship of events on campus. On day of show, he manages the Box Office and works front-of-house with the Selections Director.
Promotions Director: Hannah Devine-Rader

Co-Sponsorship
CCC is always open to assist funding to outside organizations for the production of musical events. Working alongside organizations such as SPICMACAY, Haven, JAM, and ASHA Cornell, CCC has been able to fund and help produce acts ranging from Bulgarian and Indian folk music to LGBTQ raves. If you are interested in having CCC co-sponsor your organization, please reach out to finance director Victoria Reiter at ver22@cornell.edu.

Once the co-sponsorship is submitted, the CCC e-board will ask a representative of the organization to come to an e-board meeting. There, the representative will be asked to give a presentation of the event, covering the event’s purpose, amount requested, budgeting, promotional plans, and more. If the executive board approves the event, the representative is asked to present once more at the General Body (gbody) meeting. The gbody will ask questions and and ultimately decide whether or not to fund the event, and if so, determine the amount of funding.
