# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is cornell concert commission. They meet the rules of the project because they are a client in need of a website and we do not have any personal
relationship within the club.


### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

     The Cornell Concert Commission is a student organization at Cornell University dedicated to organizing and promoting live music events on campus. Our purpose is to bring diverse and exciting musical performances to the student body, enhancing campus life through music.

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

    CCC is the only organization on campus that offers concerts of such a large scale and brings in artists from the indie and mainstream scenes that students want to hear on a regular basis. It also fosters a unique club culture, and provides students with the unique experience of working on the floor of a concert.

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

    Our current site is managed through Cornell Blogs and therefore is easy to manage but looks boring and doesn't have good discoverability. It also doesn't represent the club or it's current atmosphere well.

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

    Our website will be for anyone who wants to know about the club. This will probably primarily be students, faculty, community members, and maybe others involved in the local music scene, but the club's rich history is interesting to anyone with a cursory knowledge of the club.

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

    We want most visitors to see the information about our latest concerts and promotions, and to know how to participate with and engage with the club if they want to. It's also an option to learn detailed information about the club such as eboard members or past shows.

6. What are your goals for this site?

    The biggest goal for this site is to present information about current club events in a way that is exciting and drives public interest in the club. We want to show people that the club and the concerts are exciting and that there is vibrant culture behind them, things the current site does not convey.

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

    Black and white are the main colors of the club, which evokes a professional feel, but we want the imagery and stylings to feel slick, modern, and alternative to reflect the club culture.

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?

    Pitchfork's website is a similar style to what we want to evoke: sleek and modern yet exciting and alternative. They are also a music site. Two other sites to keep in mind are the club's current site, which despite a bad style has decent organization, and the club's instagram, which the website should stand out from in order to justify its existence.

### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site significantly that meets the project's requirements.

The client, the Cornell Concert Commission, is in need of a website. The purpose of this website is to serve as the primary platform for promoting and managing live music events on Cornell's campus. The website will feature information about upcoming concerts, artist profiles, ticket sales, and integration with their social media. The website our client wants is a website that will engage their target audience, primarily Cornell students, faculty, staff, and local music enthusiasts. It will also help in promoting their events effectively and increasing ticket sales.


### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Improved User Experience: Create a user-friendly and modern website that is easy to navigate, ensuring visitors can quickly access event information and purchase tickets.
- Increased Ticket Sales: The website should encourage ticket sales for their events by providing a seamless ticket purchasing experience.
- Enhanced Online Presence: The website should serve as a central hub for their community.


### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

It aims to fulfill the specific needs of the Cornell Concert Commission by providing essential features for event promotion, ticket sales, and audience engagement. The website scope is not too small, as it covers a range of features like event listings, artist profiles, and ticket sales, which meet the client's objectives. It's not too large, as it focuses on core functionalities, ensuring that the website remains manageable and is completed within a reasonable timeframe.

### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Pitchfork's website features a clean and modern design, with a prominent navigation bar for easy access to various sections. Its design effectively highlights featured content, articles, and upcoming events. The homepage employs a grid layout to showcase featured content, providing an organized and visually appealing presentation. It employs common design patterns, including responsive navigation menu and side bars. The responsive design seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes, and the transition to a hamburger menu on narrow screens ensures a smooth and clutter-free mobile experience. For the interactivity on this website, it employs a modal for subscriptions of newsletter enhances user engagement and encouraging users to subscribe while minimizing disruption to the overall browsing experience. The use of hamburger menu provides a compact and accessible navigation option, allowing users to easily explore different sections of the website without cluttering the interface.


### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site


I think that website is very well made, the color theme matches of dark colors is very aesthetically pleasing and draws attention to the content. The design patterns and interactivity used such as the hamburger menu on the narrow screen and the youtube videos are allow me to easily navigate through the site and find nesscessary information. The minimalist approach, combined with clear call-to-action elements, guides users seamlessly through the site, ensuring that important information, such as upcoming events or ticket sales, is easily accessible and prominently displayed. This emphasis on user-friendly design principles contributes to a positive user experience, encouraging visitors to explore the website and participate in the club's activities.



### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The website is very simple and organized, with a consistent theme/aesthetic throughout all the pages. The layout allows users to easily find necessary information on songs, albulm purchasing, about the artists, and more. The clean, yet detailed approach in the design of the website, along with the creative use of images being used as links, videos, and a responsive footer contributes to a user-friendly website that encourages users to explore more and dive deeper into the website. It employs common design pattern including hamburger navigation menu. Also, it uses modals including subscriptions to newsletter to improve its interactivity.

Collectively, this content addresses the audience's varied interests, information needs, and potential engagement goals.



## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

**Iteration 1**

![sort 1](design-plan/../sketch1.jpeg)

this iteration of sketch priotizing the order of information. It places information like the contact information on the home page and how to join information on the e-board page for ease of access

**Iteration 2**
![sort 2](sketch2.jpeg)
We tried putting how to join in the FAQ page to see if that would make more sennse.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

We will use the first iteration of card sorting, sort 1.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

This make sense for our audience as it groups all relevent information together and makes it so that they can access all necessary information on the go.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Upcoming events page
- Home page
- FAQ page
- E-board page
- Past events

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

The chosen names for the website's navigation pages are carefully crafted to resonate with the interests and goals of the Cornell Concert Commission's diverse audience. The "Upcoming Events" page directly addresses the audience's interests in staying informed about upcoming concerts and events, including ticket details. The "Home" page serves as a welcoming and central hub, providing a comprehensive overview of the organization's identity, mission, and purpose. The "FAQ" page caters to potential members and event attendees, offering clear guidelines and answers to common queries. The "E-board" page introduces the club's leadership, fostering a connection between the audience and the individuals driving the organization. Lastly, the "Past Events" page appeals to users interested in the club's history and previous activities, aligning with their potential curiosity and desire to explore the organization's  background.


## Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

One of the main goals for this project is to improve the website from the current cornell blogs website. In our initial interaction with the client, the main thing they seemed to highlight about the existing website was that it felt too stiff, and more resembled what one might expect from a website of an academic club. It also feels a bit "old web." They said they wanted CCC's public presence to be more hip and lighthearted. Therefore, one idea for a theme would be a very flashy, almost even tacky or punk bright theme that emphasized the club's alternative spirit and the students (rather than fauclty / organizations) behind it. This theme would seek to be as inviting as possible to other students seeking an unprofessional, casual club, using rounded letters and shapes, and lots of flashy, contrasting bright colors.

The first idea leans heavily into the casual, alternative aspects of the club, but it's also important to emphasize the club's professional side. CCC is proud of its long history of hosting noteworthy artists, as well as the professional relationship it seeks to have with its clients and with cornell's administration. This second theme idea balances the professionality of the club with the desire to have a "cooler," more modern feeling website. Like the club's logo, this theme primarily uses white content on a black background. This simple, minimalist color palette  looks professional, and the black background with white text is reminiscent of "dark mode" websites or applications, which is notoriously popular among young people. Balance between profesionality and modernity can also be achieved with sharp lines and corners around text and content boxes, while using rounded, inviting, casual text for contrast. This also follows the aesthetic of many modern music websites such as pitchfork, which use minimalist color palettes and clearly defined borders.

We ended up choosing the second theme because while it maintains the goal of creating a sleeker, younger looking website, it doesn't alienate older viewers or sacrifice the club's professional presence (and perhaps even adds to it, as the website will look more modernized and therefore more cared for / maintained).

## Design (Milestone 2)

Document your site's layout.

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Photo gallery
- Modal pop-up for artists
- Modal for map


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![homepage](home-page-interactivity.jpg)
At Home Page we considered to employ a photo gallary. On the wide version, we have a wide photo gallary showing one photo each time, with an arrow pointing to the right and an arrow pointing to the left on each side of the photo. In the sketch we can see that, with the first photo showing on the gallary, if the right arrow is clicked, the second picture will be presented. In addition, a hamburger menu was also employed



![FAQ wide](design-plan/../FAQ-wide.jpeg)
![FAQ narrow](design-plan/../FAQ-narrow.jpeg)

For the FAQ page, we considered to employ a modal. This made it so that whenever the side of the map was clicked, a bigger image of the map would show up. This was cued by hovering on the map where a shadow would show it was interactive. IN the sketch, we see how when the image is clicked, the map gets bigger.

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Please provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Narrow Design:**


- Home
  ![Home narrow](design-plan/../home-narrow-final.jpg)
  Explaination: The design for the narrow homepage is straightforward. It employs the classic design principles of vertically orienting content and using a collapsable hamburger menu to make the menu easier to access. The primary content that it houses is a photo gallery and some text content giving a high level overview of what CCC is.

- FAQ
  ![FAQ narrow](design-plan/../FAQ-finalsketchnarrow.png)

### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?


This website's deisng is appropriate for my audience. The content organization makes sense for our audience as it groups all relevent information together and makes it so that they can access all necessary information on the go. The home page mostly serves to meet the second goal of gaining knowledge about CCC. The home page of any site also serves the purpose of captivating the audience's attention within 10 seconds by giving a quick, visceral introduction to the site. This page quickly grabs user's attention with flashy pictures from shows, and also houses the most broad strokes, general information about the club, which will control the user's expectations and perceptions for traversing the rest of the site if they wish. This general info is also the "if you don't learn anything else, learn this" info for this site, which is appropriate as it will be the first thing people see. The upcoming events page allows for users to see upcoming events from the CCC. It is filled with bright colors and generates excitement for upcoming events. The design makes information easily accessible and of a familiar style. The design of the FAQ page enhances the site's functionality by making it easier for users to find the information they are looking for and to plan accordingly to the rules for their concert. The past events page employed common design pattern including hamburger menu as well as side bar, effectively improved the familarity of the site for my audience. The eboard page provides users with direct pathways to explore the leadership behind the club, fostering a connection between the audience and the organization. In summary, the design choices prioritize user experience, using common desing patterns like sidebar and hamburger menu, making it easy for the audience to navigate, discover, and engage with the content that matters most to them. It offers insight on how to join and the audience gains knowledge about the club which is one of the goals of our audience.







## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.


The map modal on the FAQ page provides a convenient way for users to get a closer look at the location of the concert, providing a convenient way for users to easily find the building.

Also the proposed responsive hamburger menu, adapting to a horizontal navigation bar on wide screens and a collapsed menu on narrow screens, serves to optimize user navigation across various devices. This design choice ensures a clean and intuitive experience, meeting industry standards for usability. By seamlessly adjusting to different screen sizes, the interactivity enhances overall accessibility, aligning with the diverse needs of the site's audience and elevating their browsing experience.

A common confusion among the public regarding CCC is what kind of concerts we offer, as Cornell is more well known for orchestra / cultural events hosted by organizations such as the concert series. The picture slideshow gives users clarity about what kind of concerts CCC hosts, as well as letting users browse images with the arrow buttons. This allows them to either search for artists they know, or just look at many interesting / visually satisfying images. The interactivity allows us to show off the diversity in the concerts that CCC offers without clogging the page with many different instances of a single image, which would distract the user and make it more difficult to see each image individually or find the text content at the bottom of the page. The carousel allows the images to greet the user front and center, while also creating sufficient room for multiple images. A carousel on the home page is also a common modern design pattern and will impress and satisfy users by meeting expectations.




## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the HTML elements, CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.
