# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Communicate clearly and efficiently with each other
    - Do our best on all assignments to ensure high academic performance
    - Get assignments in on time, to the best of our ability


2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - Respect: We will treat each team member with respect, valuing their opinions and ideas. We will not interrupt when someone is speaking and will actively listen.
    - Responsibility: We all share responsibilities for design and coding. No one is limited to a single role. We will make an effort to divide work as evenly as possible.
    - Accountability: In the case that someone cannot complete their work, it is expected that a) they will communicate this so that the other team members can work to make up for it and b) find a way to make it up to the teammates affected.
    Communication: We will use iMessages to stay in touch. Our communication should be professional and timely.


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will meet once a week, on Saturday from 5-7pm. We will meet in person, but if something comes up, we will resort to zoom or a reschedule another day.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    We will communicate through emails.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.



- Project Manager: Responsible for task allocation and project timeline management (Noah, Xiaokun)
- Client Liaison: Manages client communication and expectations (Tami, Fatou)
- Checklist Reviewer: Goes over the checklist before each submission to double check that our project meets all the requirements. (Gregorio)


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

- We will hold each other and ourselves accountable by having weekly items due for each individual. If someone is not contributing equally, we will stage an intervention and have a group meeting.
- If someone does something you believe to be insufficient or otherwise problematic, communicate that to them and have an open conversation. If their behavior does not change, it is now in your right to mark them off for it in the peer feedback at the end of the project, which will affect their grade.


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    Creative conflicts between team members will be resolved by a blind vote of all team members, using StrawPoll. In a team meeting, each member involved in the conflict will have five minutes to present and defend their choice. Afterwards, each member present at the meeting will cast one vote. This will be determined by majority. In the case that there is a tie, the project manager will have final say.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    When we are having conflict or disagreements we will refer back to the contract for guidance.

9.  What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

     We acknowledge that work-life balance is essential. After successful project milestones, we will celebrate by getting ice cream.



## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
