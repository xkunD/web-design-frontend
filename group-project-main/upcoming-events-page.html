      <h3>Artist Bio</h3>
      <section>
        <h2>Maia: Indie pop sensation</h2>
        <p>The Cornell Concert Commission and the Cornell Asian Pacific Student Union are excited to present mxmtoon
          with
          special guest Paravi on November 17th in Statler Auditorium! Tickets start at $5 and can be purchased with the
          link in our bio.</p>

        <p> Maia, known professionally as mxmtoon, is an Indie pop sensation who began self-releasing music on YouTube
          in
          2017. In 2019, Maia released “prom dress.” With melodic production from indie pop artist Cavetown, Maia
          reflects
          on her high school experience in this heartfelt, witty smash hit track.</p>

        <p>Maia’s 2022 sophomore album “rising” provides listeners with another comforting record while developing her
          voice as a songwriter. “rising” features dimensional production exploring a mix of sonic moods on the album’s
          strongest tracks like “sad disco” and “mona lisa.” In an interview with Song Exploder, Maia breaks down “mona
          lisa,” expressing her desire to “make something that felt empowering without trying to hide myself.” She cites
          having fun with writing herself as a famous painting as someone who grew up with a lack of representation.
          Maia
          is a multiracial bisexual woman who uses her platform to make space for her predominantly female, POC, and
          LGBTQ+ fanbase. Maia continues to explore themes of love, feeling out of place, and self-fulfillment with a
          newfound perspective that the album’s closing track “coming of age” embraces with open arms. In celebration of
          her personal and artistic growth, Maia is currently working on “plum blossom (revisited)” which is set to
          release November 10th, 2023.</p>

        <p>Indian-American pop artist Paravi has built an audience of over 2 million followers. Her 2021 take on Beach
          Bunny's "Cloud 9" became a TikTok sensation achieving more than 40 million views. This past September, Paravi
          released her self-titled sophomore EP reflecting on her ancestry, self image, and heartbreak. Paravi aims “to
          carve a path for young Indian girls coming up behind me to make it easier for them to achieve their dreams” by
          celebrating her culture as well as what makes her different. Paravi’s strong sense of self echoes through all
          her tracks, inviting listeners to take pride in who they are.</p>
