        <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
        <div class="readable">
            <p>
                My academic journey has been a fascinating one. I started my undergraduate studies at University College
                London (UCL) in the United Kingdom, where I delved into the world of Electrical and Electronic
                Engineering. It was there that I developed a strong foundation in the field and nurtured my passion for
                all things related to electronics.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most exciting chapters of my academic life began when I embarked on an exchange program at
                Cornell University. This cross-continental transition allowed me to experience different teaching
                methodologies, cultures, and perspectives in the field of engineering. It's been an enriching experience
                that has broadened my horizons and deepened my love for the subject.

        <h2>The Future Awaits</h2>
        <div class="readable">
            <p>
                As I continue my academic journey and explore my passions, I am excited about the future. I aspire to
                become a professional electrical engineer who contributes to innovative projects that can make a
                positive impact on society. I'm also eager to continue my adventures, both in the world of engineering
                and on my travels.
