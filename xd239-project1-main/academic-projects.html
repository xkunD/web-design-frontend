        <h2>Automatic Car with Maze | May 2022</h2>
        <!-- Academic project: Automatic Car with Maze -->
        <div class="readable">
            <p>
                In this project, we used arduino to make a simple automatic car that could going through any maze we
                setted for it. It was achieved with two main parts: sensing and driving.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the sensing, we used pull-up resistors with push buttons for the detection of hard side walls, and
                employed photodiode with NPN BJT resistors to build up the forward sensing circuit. By continuesly test
                the performance of the photodiode as well as the push buttons, we could find the suitable values of the
                resistors in both circuits, as well as the threshold value that should be used in the arduino program.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the driving part, when the robot is close to the wall, it senses the proximity and stops the output
                to the motor by setting the DIGITAL OUTPUT pin to LOW. When there is no obstruction in front of the
                robot, the DIGITAL OUTPUT pin is set to HIGH and the robot moves forward. The transistor gets a
                controlled base current and amplifies it accordingly to achieve 1A current for the motors. Because the
                robot only moves forwards, we only need to consider the situation when the robot moves forwards and
                stops moving forwards.

        <!-- Academic project: Self-made Tin-can Phone -->
        <h2>Self-made Tin-can Phone | Oct 2022</h2>
        <div class="readable">
            <p>
                This project aims at designing, demonstrating and analysing a tin-can acoustic communication system for
                speech transmitting. The developed system is made of two paper cups attached to either end with a taut
                nylon fish string of 2.0 meters length and 0.2mm diameter.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to experiment results, A power gain of above 20 dB was achieved at frequency of 700 - 800 Hz,
                showing the effective transmission performed by the phone system. Negative power gain appeared with
                frequency ranging from 1000 to 1600 Hz.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, the performance of the phone depends on the setting up, cans and the string, and the system
                performs the most effectively when the frequency of the transmitted sound is around its natural resonant
                frequency.

        <!-- Academic project: Muscle Movement Detector -->
        <h2>Muscle Movement Detector | Jan 2023</h2>
        <div class="readable">
            <p>
                The Muscle Movement Detector project, undertaken in January 2023, represents a fascinating exploration
                of biomedical engineering and sensor technology. This innovative project aimed to develop a system
                capable of detecting and analyzing muscle movements, opening doors to various applications in the fields
                of healthcare, fitness, and assistive technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project involved a multidisciplinary approach, combining digital and analog components. The core of
                the detector was powered by an MSP432 microcontroller, which served as the digital processing unit. The
                analog component consisted of carefully designed circuits and sensors for capturing muscle activity.

                The process of the Muscle Movement Detector can be summarized as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Sensor Placement: Specialized sensors were strategically placed on the user's skin over the target
                    muscles. These sensors were designed to measure electrical signals generated by muscle contractions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Signal Acquisition: The analog circuitry interfaced with the sensors and amplified the minute
                    electrical signals, making them suitable for digital processing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Digital Analysis: The MSP432 microcontroller received the amplified signals, processed them in
                    real-time, and performed various analyses to detect the onset, duration, and intensity of muscle
                    movements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feedback or Data Storage: Depending on the application, the detector could provide immediate
                    feedback to the user, record data for later analysis, or transmit information to other devices or
                    systems.
                </li>
            </ol>
