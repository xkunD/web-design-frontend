                I kicked off my piano journey at the tender age of 4, and what a whirlwind it's been! Music turned out
                to be my jam, big time! I've got this nifty thing called "absolute pitch" that lets me ID any note, and
                my radar for pitch, notes, and music vibes is just uncanny.

                Back in primary school, I jumped into proper singing training and boy, did I snag a bunch of wins in
                competitions. Middle school came around, and I hopped onto the Bel Canto train as a Soprano. Check out
                my piano performance on my YouTube Channel at

                Guitar came into the picture after middle school, and guess what? I brought my fave guitar all the way
                from London to Ithaca this fall. It's been a groovy ride, and I'm just getting started!

                For the past four years, I've proudly supported the Manchester City football team. Since beginning my
                journey at a UK university, I've had the incredible opportunity to witness their matches live on
                numerous occasions. Allow me to share some of these unforgettable experiences with you!

        <h3>Manchester City vs PSG</h3>
        <div class="readable">
            <p>
                During the group stage of the UCL on November 24, 2021, I had the thrilling chance to attend the game at
                the Etihad Stadium, Manchester City's home. The excitement was palpable as I watched my beloved team
                triumph over PSG. The atmosphere was electric, with jubilation all around. I even had the surreal
                pleasure of meeting some of my favorite players in person!

            <p>
                On June 10, 2023, the stage was set for one of the most riveting and nerve-wracking matches‚ÄîManchester
                City against Inter Milan. Though I couldn't be there in person, I watched the game at a London pub,
                wearing my Mancity shirt. When we emerged victorious in the UCL final, tears of joy streamed down my
                face. This was a dream I had cherished for so long, and it finally came true.

                I love travelling and I have been to more than 8 countries in the past two years. My adventure map spans
                the whole deal, from the beautiful views in the Europe, to the delicious food in the Mexico. If I had to
                pick my favourates, Spain, Italy, Austria, and Mexico take the crown.
